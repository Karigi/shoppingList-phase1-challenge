This project is a shopping list where a user can
enter an item by typing into the input field and once
they click a add button, the item is added to a list.
The user can mark an item as purchased and can also edit
an existing item on the list. Once marked as done a 
strikethrough is placed on the item. There is also a 
clear list button whereby the user can clear the entire
shopping list and start a new.
On refreshing the page, the shopping list is still available
since the list is stored in the browser's local storage.
There are three different files in the project: a HTML file, a 
css file and a javascript file. The HTML file contains the basic tags
for inputing items into the input field, and the add and clear list
buttons. The mark as purchased and edit button are added to the 
HTML file through the innerHTML property inside the javascript
file. The css file contains the styling of the HTML elements. The 
javascript file contains the DOM manipulation methods for a dynamic
shopping list.
